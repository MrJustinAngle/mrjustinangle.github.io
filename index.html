        <p>
          Throughout this course, the Computer Science program, and the development of this ePortfolio, I have grown significantly in both technical skill and professional awareness. This program has provided me with opportunities to explore various areas of computer science and to demonstrate the strengths I’ve developed along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time in the program, I completed multiple projects that exposed me to different potential career paths within the field. One of the more notable projects, not featured on this site, involved developing a web application for a company that allowed them to host and edit their website through a secure backend portal. This project included database integration and administrative access for managing content and services securely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program also helped prepare me to thrive in collaborative environments. Through group projects and shared workspaces, I developed the ability to work effectively with others, communicate clearly with stakeholders, and ensure their needs were reflected in the software solutions we produced. I frequently used MongoDB to apply knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and in every coding project, I ensured the use of industry-standard practices—including secure coding techniques and detailed code documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three enhanced projects featured on this site demonstrate a wide range of the competencies I’ve acquired. These projects align with the program's five core course outcomes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhancement One</strong><br>
          This project allowed me to demonstrate my ability to apply well-founded and innovative techniques, tools, and skills to implement computing solutions that provide real-world value. It also reflects a strong security mindset, as I incorporated the latest security patches and ensured the software was hardened against potential vulnerabilities. The code was well-commented to aid future developers and maintain clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhancement Two</strong><br>
          This backend system supports managing contacts and appointments. Through this project, I met additional course outcomes: designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles, and fostering collaborative practices that support organizational decision-making. It also involved thoughtful trade-offs in design choices, balancing functionality with efficiency and maintainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhancement Three</strong><br>
          The third project involved developing a dashboard that efficiently queries a MongoDB database using CRUD operations, advanced indexing, and aggregation. This enhancement not only improved performance but also supported clear, user-centered design. With this project, I fulfilled the outcome of producing professional-quality written, visual, and oral communications tailored to both technical and non-technical audiences. The dashboard's usability and the enhanced documentation serve as evidence of this competency.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, this program has equipped me with the technical foundation, collaborative experience, and professional mindset to succeed in the field of computer science. These projects are a testament to the progress I’ve made and the value I’m ready to bring to future teams and organizations.
